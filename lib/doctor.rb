# The Doctor class needs a class variable @@all that begins as an empty array.

# The Doctor class needs a class method .all that lists each doctor in the class variable.

# A doctor should be initialized with a name and be saved in the @@all array.

# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #new_appointment, that takes in 
# an instance of the Patient class and a date, and creates a new Appointment. 
# That Appointment should know that it belongs to the doctor

# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #appointments, that iterates through 
# all Appointments and finds those belonging to this doctor.

# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #patients, that iterates over that 
# doctor's Appointments and collects the patient that belongs to each Appointments.
